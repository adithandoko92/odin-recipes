        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Japanese-style pancake recipe makes fluffy pancakes that are so delicious, you might eat them without butter or syrup.</p>
        <p>The recipe is so simple that anyone can make it. Serve them right from the griddle or pan.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour and baking powder together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Slowly mix in flour mixture; batter will thicken rather quickly. Slowly blend in milk, then vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a griddle and heat over medium-high heat. Working in batches as necessary, drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
